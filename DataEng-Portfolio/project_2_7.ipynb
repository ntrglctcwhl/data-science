    "As stated in the scenario, like most companies, AGM does not want to give out its customer list to 3rd party sales channels.  The downside is, as we have seen, that customer first names, last names, and street addresses will have some variations and not be exact matches.\n",

    "# AGM Customer Data Strategy: Withholding vs. Sharing with Third Party Sales Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining data confidentiality by withholding AGM's customer list protects proprietary customer relationships and privacy, which builds long term trust with the customer base. While this approach requires data cleansing efforts to match Peak's customer records with AGM's existing database, addressing variations in names and addresses, the incremental investment in data quality processes is manageable and represents a one time cost. This option preserves AGM's competitive advantage by keeping direct customer relationships under AGM's control, allowing the company to maintain future flexibility in sales channel decisions without having already distributed sensitive customer information to third parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing AGM's customer list with Peak Deliveries would eliminate the need for data cleansing and matching, streamlining operations and reducing ongoing administrative overhead. Peak could load customers into their system, improving the customer experience by enabling faster signup and potentially driving higher adoption rates during the critical POC period. This approach would provide Peak with complete customer context, potentially leading to better service personalization and more accurate delivery logistics. However, this option permanently transfers control of AGM's valuable customer data to a third party, creating privacy and security risks, reducing negotiating leverage in future partnerships, and establishing a precedent that could complicate future business relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend that AGM continue to withhold its customer data from Peak Deliveries. While data cleansing requires upfront effort, the long term strategic value of protecting customer relationships outweighs the operational convenience of data sharing. AGM is a small company in a POC phase, meaning the data quality challenges are temporary and limited in scope. By investing in robust cleansing processes now, AGM demonstrates data governance maturity, maintains control over its most valuable business asset, and preserves flexibility for future business decisions. Should the POC prove unsuccessful, AGM will have protected its customer data from unnecessary exposure. Should it succeed, AGM will have established a sustainable operational model that protects customer privacy while supporting multi channel growth."
