    "# 1.6 Ideas on how the sales data can be used to help identify best customers\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science team would like to know your best ideas on how the sales data can be used to help identify the company's best customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "They are going to start with the most common and most basic model known as RFM, which consists of the 3 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* R - Recency - How recently did the customer purchase?\n",
    "\n",
    "* F - Frequency - How often do they purchase?\n",
    "\n",
    "* M - Monetary Value - How much do they spend?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it's pretty easy to think of a simple query for each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after some thought, it's not quite so easy. It's very open ended, with a lot of grey areas, and no single right or wrong answer (just like 99% of data science and AI!)  For each dimension, there can be some pretty complex ways to determine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science team also has to come up with a way to synthesize the 3 dimensions into a single customer value for each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science team would like for you to present your ideas in the form of a title and 4 paragraphs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Title - A title describing what you will be explaining\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recency - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine recency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Frequency - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monetary Value - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine monetary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Synthesis - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how to synthesize the 3 dimensions of recency, frequency, and monetary value into a customer value for each customer and how to determine who the best customers are.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Put the title and all 4 paragraphs in a single markdown cell.\n",

    "### Recency\n",
    "To determine **recency** of customer purchases given their name, we join the `customers` and `sales` tables on matching `customer_id`.  \n",
    "We will group by `customer_id`, and use the `MAX()` function to find the most recent date under each `customer_id`.  \n",
    "This indicates the recency of purchase and can be denoted as **`customer_recency`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency\n",
    "To display the **frequency** (within a specified date range) of customer purchases, we join the `customers` and `sales` tables on matching `customer_id`.  \n",
    "Then, grouping by `customer_id`, we calculate `COUNT(*)` of `sale_date` where the date is within the specified range (greater than a chosen **min date**, and less than a chosen **max date**).  \n",
    "The timeframe can be determined by the data science team as needed.  \n",
    "This can be denoted as **`customer_frequency`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monetary Value\n",
    "To display the **average monetary value spending** of each customer, we join the `customers` and `sales` tables on matching `customer_id`.  \n",
    "From the `sales` table, we consider `total_amount`, which is the total amount of a single sale to that customer.  \n",
    "Grouping by `customer_id`, we take the **sum of `total_amount`** and display the results as **`customer_spending`**.  \n",
    "This will give us the total amount of money that the customer has put into the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring and Limitations\n",
    "For each metric, we will **rank customers** (using `RANK()`) and give them 3 separate scores ranging from 1 to the total number of customers, denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`recency_score`**  \n",
    "- **`frequency_score`**  \n",
    "- **`spending_score`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The smaller the score, the better the customer is in that metric.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each RFM metric is considered equally important in determining a good customer (since there is no elaboration provided on which metrics the organization considers more heavily).  \n",
    "Therefore, the **average of these scores** will be taken as a customer’s cumulative score, denoted as **`customer_score`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While useful, the RFM model has limitations since it does not account for factors such as **customer age, financial status, demographics, or long-term profitability**.  \n",
    "It should therefore be considered a **starting point** for segmentation, which can be enriched with additional **behavioral, demographic, or predictive data** for a more complete view of customer value.\n"
